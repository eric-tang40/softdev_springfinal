# Description

This website retrieves and display data regarding the Top 100 billboard. The song list table gives you an idea of the ranking of the top ten songs for today.

In each song detail, you can add or remove favorites, which will appear in the favorites tab where you can also remove favorites. There is also a data analysis tab where you get analysis on the billboard for the past thirty Fridays. Multiple different users can sign up using the register feature on the website.

# Launch Codes

## Install the Prerequisites

sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

curl https://pyenv.run | bash

export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
      eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    
pyenv install â€“list

pyenv update

pyenv install 3.11.5

pyenv local 3.11.5

python -m venv env_3.11.5

## Running Virtual Env

source env_3.11.5/bin/activate (Mac/Linux) or env_3.11.5\Scripts\activate (Windows)

pip install --upgrade pip-tools pip setuptools wheel
pip-compile --upgrade --generate-hashes --output-file requirements_env/main.txt requirements_env/main.in

pip-sync requirements_env/main.txt requirements_env/dev.txt

## Run the Website

For the secrets.json, we have given a template that you must follow to be able to properly run the website. We have added an additional line for the api key to be given by the user with the project files.

You must go to the songs tab and choose a specific date on the calendar and press the "Filter" button to populate the table with all data for the filtered date, if there is any.

If there is no data available, you must press the "Get Data" button to populate the database with all the songs, for the appropriate date that you filtered.

If you added a lot of new data through the calendar and try to see a song detail, the website might take some time to load since we are accessing another API. Also, the first time you enter a new song detail, some data may be missing, but you just have to reload the page for the data to appear. We had an issue with migrations, so we had to do the process this way.

## Database Code

IMPORTANT: If you have an error migrating, you must comment out two lines of code before migrating the database models.

First, in billboard/billboard/settings.py, in the Installed Apps: 'django.contrib.admin'. We have left a comment denoting this.

Second, in billboard/billboard/urls.py, in the URL Patterns: path('admin/', admin.site.urls). We have also left a comment denoting this.

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

Go to http://localhost:8000

IMPORTANT: If you commented out the two lines of code, you must uncomment them out after migrating the database models.
